    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Baked tomato slices are a simple, flavorful side dish made by slicing
         fresh tomatoes and layering them on a baking sheet. They're typically 
         seasoned with salt, pepper, herbs like oregano or basil, and topped 
         with breadcrumbs or grated cheese such as Parmesan for extra texture 
         and flavor. After a quick bake in the oven until tender and slightly 
         crisp on top, theyâ€™re served warm as a light appetizer or a complement 
         to main dishes.
